## Why??
Some people love magoo. I hate his stupid comments like the Family Circus. The only thing worse than a magoo comment is
the inevitable thread that follows:

    I HATE you magoo!
        Oh! I love magoo!
            Magoo sucks! Why don't you ban him, Gaffin?
                ...

This plugin gets rid of it all.
