## No Magoo
This is a Chrome extension that hides comments from the user `MisterMagooForYou` and any replies to those comments on the [universalhub.com](https://universalhub.com) website..

## Installation
### Store
Grab it from the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/no-magoo/gcgopoagpalmemnbbfakmndmjnefjlme).

Check out your browser console for a count of how many comment threads have been removed.

## Why??
Some people love magoo. I dislike the comments from the account in the same way the character Todd Gaines disliked the
Family Circus in the 1999 movie _Go_. The only thing worse than a magoo comment is the inevitable thread that follows:

    I am magoo. Derp Derp Derp. I am magoo. Derp Derp
    較럭끿 I HATE you magoo!
        較럭끿 Oh! I love magoo!
            較럭끿 Magoo sucks! Why don't you ban him, Gaffin?
                較럭끿 ...

This plugin gets rid of it all. All comments by magoo - and replies to those comments - are completely removed from the
DOM. You won't see them. If you use a screen reader, you won't hear them. 游뿏
